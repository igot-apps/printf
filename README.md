Project Tasks

These are the tasks that constitute this project, with links to the corresponding files where they have been completed:

Implement a function that generates output based on the provided format. This includes support for 'c' and 's' conversion specifiers.

Handle additional conversion specifiers: 'd' and 'i' for base-10 integers.

Create a comprehensive man page for your custom _printf function.

Extend conversion specifier support to include 'b' for binary representation.

Further expansion of conversion specifiers to include 'u' for unsigned integers, 'o' for octal numbers, 'x' for lowercase hexadecimal, and 'X' for uppercase hexadecimal.

Optimize output handling by utilizing a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize calls to the write function.

Implement a custom conversion specifier 'S' to print strings, including non-printable characters in a specified format.

Add support for the 'p' conversion specifier, which converts an integer input into a pointer address.

Handle flag characters (+, space, #) for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Incorporate length modifiers (l and h) for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Manage field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Handle precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Implement the '0' flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Manage the '-' flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Introduce a custom conversion specifier 'r' to print reversed strings.

Create a custom conversion specifier 'R' to print strings using the rot13 encoding.

Ensure that all of the above options work seamlessly together.
